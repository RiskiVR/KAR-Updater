```
Root || the base directory we write the files in

    -Account || where account data is stored
    -Clients || where all data and boilerplate files for Netplay Clients are stored
    
    -Replays || where all Warp Records are stored

    -ROMs || where all ROMs will be stored

    -Tools || where all tools used by other programs are stored
    
    -Mods || where all mods are stored
    -Mods/SkinPacks || where all custom Skins are stored
    -Mods/Stars || where all custom stars are kept
